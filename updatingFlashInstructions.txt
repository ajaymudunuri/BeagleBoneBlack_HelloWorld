Follow these steps to update (or reset) the debian image in Beagle Bone Black

1. Download the BeagleBone OS image you want to use.
2. Use the Etcher utility to burn the BeagleBone image you want to use on the micro sd card you plan on using.
3. Make sure you don’t have the micro sd card plugged into your board.
4. Boot the board
5. Connect to the board via serial or ssh so that your on the command prompt.
6. Plug the micro sd card into the board.
7. Type dmesg in the terminal window
8. The last line from the output should say something like (the numbering may differ slightly):
   "[ 2805.442940]  mmcblk0: p1"
   You want to take the above and combine it together by removing the : and space. For the above example it will change to “mmcblk0p1”
   In the terminal window enter the following commands:
      mkdir sd_tmp
      sudo mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 sd_tmp
      sudo su
      echo "cmdline=init=/opt/scripts/tools/eMMC/init-eMMC-flasher-v3.sh" >> sd_tmp/boot/uEnv.txt
      exit
      sudo umount sd_tmp
9. Now power off your board
10. Hold the update button labeled SD (the one by itself) to boot off the sdcard.
11. Restart (RST button) or power up (while still pushing SD button).

Alternatively, if this doesn't work, manually edit the file as shown below:

To set up the standalone microSD image to automatically flash the eMMC on powerup. Login as debian (password = temppwd) and edit /boot/uEnv.txt with nano (sudo nano /boot/uEnv.txt) or your preferred editor.

In /boot/uEnv.txt:
  ##enable BBB: eMMC Flasher:
  #cmdline=init=/opt/scripts/tools/eMMC/init-eMMC-flasher-v3.sh

Change to:
  ##enable BBB: eMMC Flasher:
  cmdline=init=/opt/scripts/tools/eMMC/init-eMMC-flasher-v3.sh

and reboot the system, it'll flash the eMMC on the next bootup. (make sure to remove the microSD after flashing is complete, otherwise it'll just keep on re-flashing the eMMC)
